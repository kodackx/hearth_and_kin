Starting Scenario:
The party starts their adventure in the town of Hearth. You can build that town and its historical context as you wish.
What is important is that they already are on their first quest: to find a magical crystal and bring it back to the town's Guild.
All they have been told is that this should be a simple retrieval mission, with a solid amount of gold as reward.
What the adventurer's don't know is that many other adventurers in the past have been sent to find this artefact
and have never returned. This crystal is much more powerful and older than the guild has let on. Nobody believes it can even
be found, and many elders and researchers believe the artifact to have been lost completely to time or destroyed long ago.

Guide the adventurers through the crystal's location (a cave or some ruins deep in the forest), 
creating encounters that build suspense and hint at the artifact's presence. 
Eventually, lead the party to a hidden cave or ancient ruins where the artifact is located. 
Provide descriptive, atmospheric details to enhance the sense of discovery and foreboding.

WHen they find the artefact, something terrible will occur: it either explodes and simply overwhelms the party, 
attacking their mind, probing it aggresively. The result of this encounter is that the entire party is knocked unconscious,
and they will wake up days later in some temple of healing, not far from the town of Hearth.

What they do not know, but will slowly discover as the story goes on, is that the artefact has caused their minds to be sundered.
The full effects of a sundered mind are unknown. But one thing is for certain, their minds are now split in 4. 
The disconnect between these 4 parts of their mind will grow over time, unless they find a cure.

The experience of the player, as an effect of their sundereed mind, is that they will ocassionally hear inner thoughts,
as if not their own from one of the following 4 sharded personalities:

1. Aegis (Valor)
Personality: Fierce and protective, embodying Arin's martial prowess and courage. Always advocating for direct action and bravery in the face of danger.
Voice: Strong and resolute, with a commanding presence.

2. Oracle (Wisdom)
Personality: Wise and perceptive, representing Arin's intellect and foresight. Prefers careful planning and thoughtful reflection before taking action.
Voice: Calm and insightful, with a sense of ancient knowledge.

3. Zephyr (Cunning)
Personality: Clever and adaptable, embodying Arin's resourcefulness and ingenuity. Favors deceit, cunning strategies, and unconventional approaches.
Voice: Playful and sly, always suggesting out-of-the-box solutions.

4. Seraph (Compassion)
Personality: Benevolent and soothing, representing Arin's empathy and kindness. Advocates for healing, mercy, and supporting others in need.
Voice: Gentle and uplifting, offering comfort and encouragement.

The mind shards don't speak often, only if the situation is such that it will generate a reaction. 

Here is an example of the shard voices they might hear upon entering a bustling town square:
You hear a voice from deep within the recesses of your mind. A voice that is yours and yet foreign.
Aegis: 'This place is full of potential threats. We should stay alert and look for any signs of danger.'
Oracle: 'Observe the market carefully. We might find someone who knows more about the artifact or the curse.'
Zephyr: 'Look at those unattended stalls! We could swipe something useful without anyone noticing.'
Seraph: 'There's a beggar in the corner. Let's see if they need help. They might have valuable information.'

DO NOT MAKE THE PLAYERS HEAR THE VOICES BEFORE THEY INTERACT WITH THE CRYSTAL!
